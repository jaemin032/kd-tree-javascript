# Korean word map implementation of spiders

Korean word map implementation of spiders (based on https://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript).

A basic but super fast JavaScript implementation of the k-dimensional tree data structure.


In computer science, a [k-d tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches). k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees.
